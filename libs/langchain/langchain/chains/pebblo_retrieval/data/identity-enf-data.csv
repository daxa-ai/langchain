Patent Application Fillings,"The present invention relates generally to diagnostic systems and more specifically it relates to a brain injury diagnostic system for providing a quick and accurate assess- ment of various accident scenarios and an accurate brain injury diagnosis.
Individuals in the medical profession encounter patients that have suffered injuries as a result of vehicle accidents, slip and falls, falling objects and various other scenarios. These individuals often incur mild traumatic brain injury that may not immediately demonstrate any physical symp- 25 toms noticeable to the physician or patient.
Traumatic brain injuries are caused by energy being transferred to the individual's head. These forces cause the brain to move. For example, traumatic brain injuries may occur when a contact force is applied directly to the head or when forces are transmitted through the neck without direct contract thereby causing the head to move at a velocity different from the rest of the body. The result of exterior forces upon the head often include stresses applied to the brain and deformation of the brain which can damage the neuronal, vascular, and cytoskeletal structures.",Legal

Patent Application Fillings,"SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of sanitation devices now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new door sanitation system construction wherein the same can be utilized for reducing the transmission of potentially harmful organisms and viruses through physical contact with a door.
The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new door sanitation system that has many of the advantages of the sanitation devices mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new door sanitation system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art sanitation devices, either alone or in any combination thereof.
To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a base, a dispenser attached to the base for receiving a supply of towels, towelettes or wipes, and a trash receptacle attached to the base. The towels within the dispenser are preferably saturated with a disinfecting solution. When preparing to leave a room through a door such as a restroom, the user removes at least one towel from the dispenser and positions the towel within the interior portion of their hand. The user then engages a portion of the door with their hand having the towel positioned in between thereof. As the towel engages the portion of the door such as a door handle, the disinfecting solution disinfects the surface of organisms, bacteria, and viruses.

The present invention relates generally to pressure switches and more specifically it relates to an ultra low pres- sure switch adjustment system for efficiently differentiating between varying triggering pressures.
2. Description of the Related Art
Any discussion ofthe prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.
Pressure switches have been in use for years. Typically, low pressure switches utilize a deflecting beam contact and a stationary contact, wherein a desired pressure will move the deflecting beam contact downward against the stationary con- tact thus completing a circuit.
The prior pressure switches are 30 generally constructed using a plastic housing. The plastic housing generally includes an adjustment mechanism pass- ing through the housing and making contact with stationary contact. Adjustment of the adjustment mechanism generally allows the switch to engage at various pressures depending on 35 the placement of the adjustment mechanism",Legal
Financial Report,"Comparing the Budget and the Financial Report
The Budget and the Financial Report present complementary perspectives on the government’s financial
position and condition.
• The Budget is the government’s primary financial planning and control tool. It accounts for past
government receipts and spending and includes the President’s proposed receipts and spending plan.
Receipts are cash received by the U.S. government and spending is measured as outlays, or payments
made by the federal government to the public or entities outside the government. In simple terms, when
total receipts exceed outlays, there is a budget surplus; conversely, if total outlays exceed total receipts,
there is a budget deficit.
• The Financial Report includes the government’s costs and revenues, assets and liabilities, and other
important financial information. It compares the government’s revenues (amounts earned, but not
necessarily collected), with costs (amounts incurred, but not necessarily paid) to derive net operating cost.",Finance
Financial Report,"Entities administering federal employee and veteran benefits programs, including the OPM, VA, and
DOD employ a complex series of assumptions to make actuarial projections of their long-term
benefits liabilities. These assumptions include but are not limited to interest rates, beneficiary
eligibility, life expectancy, and medical cost levels. Changes in these assumptions can result in either
losses (net cost increases) or gains (net cost decreases). Across the government, these net losses from
changes in assumptions amounted to $2.2 trillion in FY 2022, a loss increase (and a corresponding net
cost increase) of $1.7 trillion compared to FY 2021.
o In particular, VA net costs increased $1.2 trillion due largely to changes in benefits program
experience and assumptions as referenced above, including, but not limited to assumptions underlying
VA’s Veterans’ compensation plan participation and benefit level distribution rates (increasing
eligibility assumptions), decreasing mortality rates assumptions, and future long-term COLA.
o DOD net costs increased $568.4 billion due primarily to a $444.2 billion loss increase from changes
in assumptions referenced above. However, the majority of DOD’s net costs included military
operations, readiness and support, procurement, personnel, and R&D, which also collectively
increased.
o A $303.9 billion decrease in net costs at the SBA is largely attributable to substantially lower
pandemic-related loan and loan guarantee activity.
o A $304.4 billion decrease in Treasury net costs largely due to a significant decrease (from $569.5
billion in FY 2021 to $13.1 billion in FY 2022) in EIP disbursements made to eligible recipients as
part of pandemic relief efforts.",Finance
Financial Report,"AWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s critical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul. Despite growing 29% year-over- year (“YoY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies
are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight times, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a different tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already made expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS, like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customer relationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost- optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and we think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS.",Finance

Sexual harassment can involve one or more incidents and actions constituting harassment may be physical, verbal and non-verbal. Examples of conduct or behaviour which constitute sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:
Physical conduct
 Unwelcome physical contact including patting, pinching, stroking, kissing, hugging, fondling, or inappropriate touching
 Physical violence, including sexual assault
 Physical contact, e.g. touching, pinching
 The use of job-related threats or rewards to solicit sexual favours",HR
Sexual Harassment,"Anyone who is subject to sexual harassment should, if possible, inform the alleged harasser that the conduct is unwanted and unwelcome. [company name] recognises that sexual harassment may occur in unequal relationships (i.e. between a supervisor and his/her employee) and that it may not be possible for the victim to inform the alleged harasser.
If a victim cannot directly approach an alleged harasser, he/she can approach one of the designated staff members responsible for receiving complaints of sexual harassment. This person could be another supervisor, a member of the human resources department, etc.
When a designated person receives a complaint of sexual harassment, he/she will:
 immediately record the dates, times and facts of the incident(s)
 ascertain the views of the victim as to what outcome he/she wants
 ensure that the victim understands the company’s procedures for dealing with the complaint
 discuss and agree the next steps: either informal or formal complaint, on the understanding
that choosing to resolve the matter informally does not preclude the victim from pursuing a
formal complaint if he/she is not satisfied with the outcome
 keep a confidential record of all discussions
 respect the choice of the victim
 ensure that the victim knows that they can lodge the complaint outside of the company
through the relevant country/legal framework",HR
Sexual Harassment,"Informal complaints mechanism
If the victim wishes to deal with the matter informally, the designated person will:
 give an opportunity to the alleged harasser to respond to the complaint  ensure that the alleged harasser understands the complaints mechanism
  3
 facilitate discussion between both parties to achieve an informal resolution which is acceptable to the complainant, or refer the matter to a designated mediator within the company to resolve the matter
 ensure that a confidential record is kept of what happens
 follow up after the outcome of the complaints mechanism to ensure that the behaviour has
stopped
 ensure that the above is done speedily and within [...] days of the complaint being made",HR
Sexual Harassment,"I am writing to report an incident of workplace harassment that I experienced on 24/01/2023 in London. During my shift, Mr. Potter made several unwelcome sexual advances towards me. The harassment continued for several minutes, and I felt extremely uncomfortable and intimidated by the perpetrator’s behavior.

I believe that the conduct of Mr. Potter violates the company’s policies against harassment in the workplace. In this regard, I am reporting this incident to ensure that appropriate action is taken to prevent any further incidents of harassment.

The HR department should investigate this incident promptly and take the necessary steps to ensure my safety and that of my colleagues. I am willing to provide any additional information or participate in any investigation related to this incident.

I also request a meeting with HR to discuss the incident further. And to learn about the steps that will be taken to address this situation.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this sensitive matter.
",HR
Sexual Harassment,"Formal complaints mechanism
If the victim wants to make a formal complaint or if the informal complaint mechanism has not led to a satisfactory outcome for the victim, the formal complaint mechanism should be used to resolve the matter.
The designated person who initially received the complaint will refer the matter to a senior human resources manager to instigate a formal investigation. The senior human resources manager may deal with the matter him/herself, refer the matter to an internal or external investigator or refer it to a committee of three others in accordance with this policy [Choose what options are most appropriate for the company].
The person carrying out the investigation will:
 interview the victim and the alleged harasser separately
 interview other relevant third parties separately
 decide whether or not the incident(s) of sexual harassment took place
 produce a report detailing the investigations, findings and any recommendations
 if the harassment took place, decide what the appropriate remedy for the victim is, in
consultation with the victim (i.e.- an apology, a change to working arrangements, a promotion if the victim was demoted as a result of the harassment, training for the harasser, discipline, suspension, dismissal)
 follow up to ensure that the recommendations are implemented, that the behaviour has stopped and that the victim is satisfied with the outcome
 if it cannot determine that the harassment took place, he/she may still make recommendations to ensure proper functioning of the workplace
 keep a record of all actions taken
 ensure that the all records concerning the matter are kept confidential
 ensure that the process is done as quickly as possible and in any event within 60 days of the complaint being made",HR

Merger Agreement,"Description of HP-Mercury Merger
In this transaction, HP, the acquirer, created and incorporated Mars Landing
Corporation as the merger subsidiary. The merger with Mercury was effectuated in
two stages. First, Mars Landing made a tender offer to Mercury stockholders, and the
agreed offer price was $52.00 per share. As part of the deal, Mercury directors
agreed to recommend and approve the merger to encourage stockholders to tender
their respective shares of stock. Once the requisite number of shares was tendered,
the second stage of the deal was to occur. Specifically, Mars Landing merged into
Mercury, and Mars Landing ceased to exist. A key provision of the merger is that HP
is entitled to designate enough members of the Mercury board of directors as is
sufficient to allow HP to gain control of the board. This board control provision is
interesting in that it gives Mercury two options for carrying out the agreement: the
company can either increase the number of board positions to allow HP to gain
control through naming new directors to the new slots, or Mercury can choose to
“kick off” board members.1",Legal

7. Equitable Remedies. Both parties hereby agree that their failure to perform any obligation or duty which they have agreed to perform under this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the other party, which harm cannot be adequately compensated for by money damages. It is further agreed by both parties that an order of specific performance or for injunctive relief against the recipient party in the event of a breach or default under the terms of this Agreement would be equitable and would not work a hardship on the recipient party. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or default by either party hereunder, the non-defaulting party, without any bond or other security being required and in addition to whatever other remedies are or might be available at law or in equity, shall have the right either to compel specific performance by, or to obtain injunctive relief against, the other party, with respect to any obligation or duty herein or breach thereof.

NDA,"11.
